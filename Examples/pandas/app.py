    You should be running this in an interactive session. If

    >>> df

    to get the url/HTML view, depending on whether you're in the
    terminal, or in IPython-Notebook.

    Please look at the source for 'app.py' for more things to try out
    in the interactive prompt.

    In particular, try modifying the df object:

    >>> df.ix[0,0] = "Pooh"

    and refreshing the grid (refresh button at bottom left corner).
